Exercise: Use the sample online API at https://reqres.in/ design and implement an API test-suite:

-> Create an API test-suite from scratch, use the programming language you feel most familiar with (preferably Java).
-> Use a framework to help you with the building blocks (e.g., REST-assured)
-> You can cover all the sample API call with different scenarios or only part of it. Quality of the code is more important compared to the number of scenarios.
